Sample Module Repository
========================

Hi future me!
 
Chances are you forked this template again to set up a new python project...
Don't be an idiot as your past you and install it with 
```
pip install -e .
```
The `-e` flag is important and installs the package in development mode, such that you can edit your code and rerun the tests immediately (withour reinstalling). Also, you cannot accidentally edit the installed version and loose all your work just as before.
