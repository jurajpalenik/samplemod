Sample Module Repository
========================

Hi future me!
 
Chances are you forked this template again to set up a new python project...
Don't be an idiot as your past you and install it with ::
 pip install -e .

The ``-e`` flag is important and installs the package in development mode, such that you can edit your code and re-run the tests immediately (withour re-installing). Also, it prevents you from accidentally editing the installed version and loosing all your work, just as before...
